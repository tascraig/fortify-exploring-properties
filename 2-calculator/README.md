# Calculator Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You have the freedom to choose button designs from the `button_options` directory or those listed in the `resource_list.md` file. The objective is to build a functional calculator that not only performs basic arithmetic operations but also showcases your ability to integrate appealing button designs and a user-friendly interface.

## Objectives
- **Implement Basic Arithmetic Functions**: Your calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Incorporate Custom Button Designs**: Utilize the button styles provided in the `button_options` directory or any of the designs mentioned in the `resource_list.md` file. This is an opportunity to make your calculator visually appealing.
- **Ensure User-friendly Interface**: Focus on the user experience by making the calculator easy and intuitive to use.

## Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Set Up Your Project**: Create a new directory for your project. Inside, you'll need three main files: `index.html`, `style.css` (scss), and `script.js`.
2. **Design Your Calculator's Layout**:
    - Use `index.html` to structure your calculator. Include a display section where the input and results will be shown and a section for the calculator buttons.
    - Pay attention to accessibility and ensure that your calculator is usable for everyone.
3. **Style Your Calculator**:
    - Use `style.css` to apply styles. Choose button designs from the resources provided and customize them as needed to fit your calculator's theme.
    - Ensure that your calculator is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Add Functionality**:
    - In `script.js`, implement the logic for arithmetic operations. Ensure that your calculator can handle basic calculations accurately.
    - Add event listeners to the buttons so that when a user clicks a button, the corresponding action is performed.
5. **Test Your Calculator**:
    - Thoroughly test your calculator to ensure it works correctly with various inputs.
    - Check for and fix any bugs or issues to ensure a smooth user experience.
6. **Review and Refine**:
    - Go over your project and look for opportunities to improve the code quality and the user interface.
    - Consider adding additional features, such as the ability to perform more complex calculations or to include a history of calculations.

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure your project is complete and thoroughly tested.
- Include a README file with an overview of your project, the steps you took, and any resources you used or found helpful.
- Submit your project by uploading it to a GitHub repository and sharing the link to your repo.
